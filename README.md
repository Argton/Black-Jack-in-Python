# Black-Jack-in-Python
Optimal Black Jack strategy based on what value card value the player stands at. In this simple program,
only Hit and Stand are considered.
The parameters are dealerStandsAt, playerStandsAt, nbrOfDecks and nbrOfGames.
If the player or dealer holds an ace and doesn't have a handvalue of 20 or 21 
-> the value of the Ace is set to 1 and the loop continues until handValue >= player- or dealerStandAt.
